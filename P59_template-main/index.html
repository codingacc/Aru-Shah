She is the modern-day 15 year old reincarnation of the Pandava Arjuna and lives in Atlanta, Georgia, with her mother. Throughout the books she goes on several quests with her friends in order to defeat her father, the antagonist, known as the Sleeper. His ultimate goal is to get the Amritha also known as the Nector of Immortality to do what he thinks will reunite his family.
